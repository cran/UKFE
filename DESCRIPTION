Description: Functions to implement the methods of the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH), associated updates and the revitalised flood hydrograph model (ReFH). Currently the package uses NRFA peak flow dataset version 14. Aside from FEH functionality, further hydrological functions are available. Most of the methods implemented in this package are described in one or more of the following: "Flood Estimation Handbook", Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (1999, ISBN:0 948540 94 X).
