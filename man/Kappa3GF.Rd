\title{Kappa3 distribution growth factors}
\usage{
Kappa3GF(lcv, lskew, RP)
}
\arguments{
\item{lcv}{linear coefficient of variation}

\item{lskew}{linear skewness}

\item{RP}{return period}
}
\value{
Kappa3 distribution estimated growth factor
}
\description{
Estimated growth factors as a function of return period, with inputs of Lcv & LSkew (linear coefficient of variation & linear skewness)
}
\details{
Growth factors are calculated by the method outlined in Kjeldsen, T (2019), 'The 3-parameter Kappa distribution as an alternative for use with FEH pooling groups.'Circulation - The Newsletter of the British Hydrological Society, no. 142
}
\examples{
# Calculate Kappa growth factor for the 100-year flood
#assuming LCV and LSKEW of 0.165 and 0.17
Kappa3GF(0.165, 0.17, RP = 100)
