\title{Hydrological plot of concurrent discharge and precipitation}
\usage{
HydroPlot(
  x,
  main = "Concurrent Rainfall & Discharge",
  ylab = "Discharge (m3/s)",
  From = NULL,
  To = NULL,
  adj.y = 1.5,
  RainAxisMax = NULL,
  plw = 1,
  qlw = 1.8,
  Return = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame with three columns in the order of date (or POSIXct), precipitation, and discharge}

\item{main}{a character string. The user chosen plot title. The default is "Concurrent Rainfall & Discharge"}

\item{ylab}{User choice for the y label of the plot. The default is "Discharge (m3/s)".}

\item{From}{a starting time for the plot. In the form of a date or POSIXct object. The default is the first row of x}

\item{To}{an end time for the plot. In the form of a date or POSIXct object. The default is the last row of x}

\item{adj.y}{a numeric value to adjust the closeness of the preciptation and discharge in the plot. Default is 1.5. A lower value brings them closer and a larger value further apart}

\item{RainAxisMax}{A numeric value for to set the maximum value of the rainfall axis. This is useful for comparing multiple plots so that they have the same scale on the rainfall axis}

\item{plw}{a numeric value to adjust the width of the precipitation lines. Default is one. A larger value thickens them and vice versa}

\item{qlw}{a numeric value to adjust the width of the discharge line. Default is 1.8. A larger value thickens them and vice versa}

\item{Return}{a logical argument with a default of FALSE. If TRUE the data-frame of time, precipitation, and flow is returned}
}
\value{
A plot of concurrent precipitation and discharge, with the former at the top and the latter at the bottom. If the Return argument equals true the associated data-frame is also returned.
}
\description{
Plots concurrent precipitation and discharge, with precipitation along the top and discharge along the bottom
}
\details{
The input of x is a dataframe with the first column being time. If the data is sub daily this should be class POSIXct with time as well as date.
}
\examples{
# Plot the Thames precipitation and discharge for the 2013 hydrological year,
# adjusting the y axis to 1.8
HydroPlot(ThamesPQ, From = "2013-10-01", To = "2014-09-30", adj.y = 1.8)
