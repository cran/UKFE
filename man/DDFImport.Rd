\title{DDF13 or DDF22 results from .xml files}
\usage{
DDFImport(x, ARF = TRUE, Plot = TRUE, DDFVersion = 22)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the xml file path}

\item{ARF}{logical argument with a default of TRUE. If TRUE, the areal reduction factor is applied to the results. If FALSE, no area reduction factor is applied. This is not relevant for a point estimate.}

\item{Plot}{logical argument with a default of TRUE. If TRUE the DDF curve is plotted for a few return periods}

\item{DDFVersion}{Version of the DDF model (numeric). either 22 or 13. The default is 22.}
}
\value{
A data frame of DDF results (mm) with columns for duration and rows for return period. If Plot equals TRUE a DDF plot is also returned.
}
\description{
Imports the depth duration frequency 2013 or 2022 results from xml files either from an FEH webservice download or from the Peakflows dataset downloaded from the national river flow archive (NRFA) website
}
\details{
This function returns a data-frame of design rainfall estimates. For further durations and return periods, the separate DDF function can be applied with the data-frame as the argument/input.
}
\examples{
# Import DDF22 results from an NRFA Peak Flows XML file and display them in console
\dontrun{
ddf22_4003 <- DDFImport(r"{C:\Data\NRFAPeakFlow_v11\Suitable for QMED\04003.xml}")
ddf22_4003
}

# Import DDF22 results from a FEH webserver XML file and display them in the console
\dontrun{
ddf22_my_site <- DDFImport(r"{C:\Data\FEH_Catchment_384200_458200.xml}")
ddf22_my_site
}
