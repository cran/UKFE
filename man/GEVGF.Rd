\title{Generalised extreme value distribution growth factors}
\usage{
GEVGF(lcv, lskew, RP)
}
\arguments{
\item{lcv}{linear coefficient of variation}

\item{lskew}{linear skewness}

\item{RP}{return period}
}
\value{
Generalised extreme value estimated growth factor
}
\description{
Estimated growth factors as a function of return period, with inputs of Lcv & LSkew (linear coefficient of variation & linear skewness)
}
\details{
Growth factors are calculated by the method outlined in the Flood Estimation Handbook, volume 3, 1999.
}
\examples{
#Estimate the 50-year growth factors from Lcv = 0.1704 and Lskew = 0.0421
GEVGF(0.1704826, 0.04211332, RP = 50)
